Data Analysis Project on Israeli Protests on Twitter

This project focuses on analyzing public opinion on the ongoing protests in Israel using Twitter data. 
Twitter is a social network and an important source of real-time information it can be used to gauge public sentiment on a variety of topics. The protests in Israel have been ongoing for a number of weeks and relate to the change/reform/revolution in the justice system that the government led by Benyamin Netanyahu is promoting, 
which causes great controversy among the Israeli public.

To gather Twitter data, I used Tweepy, a Python library for accessing the Twitter API. 
I searched for tweets containing specific keywords related to the protests in Israel, such as "protest," "government," and "democracy." 
I also filtered out retweets to ensure that our dataset only contained original tweets.

Next, I used sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of each tweet. 
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves using machine learning algorithms to identify and classify the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. 
In this project, I used the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool, which is specifically designed for social media text and is trained on a large corpus of social media data.

Analyzing the sentiment of tweets related to the ongoing protests in Israel provides us with valuable insights into public opinion on this critical issue. 
The sentiment analysis allows us to understand whether people are expressing positive, negative, or neutral emotions toward the protests and specific issues. 
The sentiment analysis can also help us understand the underlying causes of the protests, such as government policies or social injustice, and aid in developing long-term solutions to these issues. 
Overall, the sentiment analysis of Twitter data is a powerful tool for gaining insights into public opinion on the ongoing protests in Israel.

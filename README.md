Data Analysis Project on tweets analysis from the protests in Israel

This project focuses on analyzing public opinion on the ongoing protests in Israel using Twitter data. 
Twitter is a social network and an important source of real-time information it can be used to gauge public sentiment on a variety of topics. The protests in Israel have been ongoing for a number of weeks and relate to the change/reform/revolution in the justice system that the government led by Benyamin Netanyahu is promoting, 
which causes great controversy among the Israeli public.

To gather Twitter data, I used Tweepy, a Python library for accessing the Twitter API. 
I searched for tweets containing specific keywords related to the protests in Israel, such as "protest," "government," and "democracy." 
I also filtered out retweets to ensure that our dataset only contained original tweets.

Next, I used sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of each tweet. 
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves using machine learning algorithms to identify and classify the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. 
In this project, I used the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool, which is specifically designed for social media text and is trained on a large corpus of social media data.

Gaining valuable insights into public opinion on the ongoing protests in Israel can be achieved through sentiment analysis of related tweets. This analysis enables us to comprehend whether individuals express positive, negative, or neutral emotions towards the protests and specific concerns, with scores ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive). Overall, analyzing Twitter data sentiment is an effective method of comprehending public sentiment on the ongoing protests in Israel.
